public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). PCR testing capacity is especially important in the hospital setting for clinical decision making and infection control procedures [3]. Yet, the inability to scale up testing has been one of the most discussed topics in
patients with COVID-19 demonstrate a distinct pattern to that of other diseases [3, 8–11]. These

markers that include inflammatory markers could predict the presence or absence of COVID-19
to develop a machine learning algorithm to serve as a proxy to diagnose COVID-19 in the hospital setting. Our set of features were selected based on prior studies reporting a difference in
these features between patients with and without COVID-19, and higher values in those with
severe COVID-19 compared to mild COVID-19 [3, 8–11]. This study was deemed nonhuman-subjects research by the institutional review board (IRB) at UCLA as all analyses used

COVID-19. We built the algorithm based on a set of basic demographic characteristics and frequently obtained blood biomarkers that could be easily obtained in many hospital settings.
Thus, the most likely application of the approach presented in this work is the use of these biomarkers as a proxy for testing in locations where COVID-19 testing is scarce. We showed a
high sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis when compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR testing as
whereby a clinician inputs the obtained values and receives immediate prediction on the probability of a particular patient having COVID-19. Further validation will be required to ascertain its performance in other medical centers.
