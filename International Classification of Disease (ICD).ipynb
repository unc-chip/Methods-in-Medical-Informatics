ICD is a nomenclature of the disease occurring in humans, with each listed disease assigned a unique identifying code. The World Health Organization also produces a specialized cancer nomenclature, known as the ICD-O (ICD-Oncology). In this chapter, we will be using ICD and ICD-O in scripts. Lets begin!\n",
