    "Throughout history, people have tried to remove confidential, private, offensive,\n",
    "and objectionable text from documents.\n",
    "Human censors do an adequate job when the data flow is small, but the amount of\n",
    "sensitive information created digitally is enormous. Large hospitals create\n",
    "terabytes of information every week, and a good portion of that information comes in\n",
    "the form of free text. Patient medical records are confidential. Those who want to use\n",
    "this information for research purposes have two options: (1) obtain informed consent\n",
    "from patients to use their records (an impossible task if you want to analyze data from\n",
    "thousands of human subjects), or (2) deidentify the records by removing any information\n",
    "that could link the contents of a medical record to an individual patient.\n",
    "In the past several decades, a variety of programs have been written that attempt to\n",
    "automatically remove confidential information from medical\n",
    "records. These programs are sometimes called “scrubbers”, and most of these programs\n",
    "use the following algorithm:\n",
    "1. Prepare lists of patient names, hospital staff names, addresses, obscenities,\n",
    "objectionable hospital slang, and hospital identifier numbers.\n",
    "2. Parse through the text, deleting or replacing entries from the list with noninformational\n",
    "characters.\n",
    "3. Match the text against a series of regex patterns that might indicate the presence\n",
    "of identifying information (e.g., formalisms such as Mr., Dr., Mrs. followed\n",
    "by another word, or numeric values, or date components), and remove\n",
    "these strings.\n",
    "These methods are the software equivalent of the human who reads through letters\n",
    "and documents and marks over the objectionable parts. Parsing scripts that pass documents\n",
    "through a long series of regex filters are always slow, and they never completely\n",
    "remove objectionable material. They merely reduce the occurrences of objectionable\n",
    "text, without eliminating the problem.\n",

    "There is a better way that is essentially the reverse of censorship. You create a list\n",

    "included on your list. This method can parse text very quickly, because it has no regex\n",
    "filters. The method is potentially perfect, because the only text that appears in the final\n",
